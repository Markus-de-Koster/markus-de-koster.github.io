Welcome to my personal blog! 

I'm Markus, a PhD Student working at TH Köln in the field of Machine Learning (ML) for Power Systems.
Research on the intersection of these two fields is my passion, and I love diving deep into the mathematics and algorithms.

In this blog, I share experiences, insights into my research, and various topics that interest me.

If you would like to get in touch, get access to any of my projects/papers or just say hi, please feel free to reach out to me!
