We verified our neural-network-based state estimation algorithms in a real microgrid laboratory at TH Köln, achieving high accuracy for predictions of power quality.
The results were presented at the "Zukünftige Stromnetze" conference in Berlin, January 29-30, 2025.

You can find the poster below (in German).
