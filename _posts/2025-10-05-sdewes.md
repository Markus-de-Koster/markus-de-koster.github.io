From October 5th to 10th, I attended the SDEWES 2025 conference in Dubrovnik, Croatia.
There, I presented our research on synthetic topology generation of distribution grids.

We generate grids using a combination of random tree and probabilistic Markov chain models, and evaluate how well the generated grids match real-world grids in terms of various graph metrics.

Eventually, I will use the generated grids to train neural networks for my PhD research.
