I'm Markus, a PhD Student working at TH Köln in the field of Machine Learning (ML) for Power Systems.
Research on the intersection of these two fields is my passion, and I love diving deep into the mathematics and algorithms.

In this blog, I share experiences, insights into my research, and various topics that interest me.
